# gamewebAPI
An ICS4U Assignment where you must request information from a public web API and use it in a program

## Some API’s that may be of use to me/ interest me  are as follows;
* [Freegamelist](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc). I sometimes find myself having nothing to do. I don’t feel like playing any of my existing games and want a new experience but also don’t want to give my money to Steam and go through the process of hoping that I’d decide on whether or not I like a game before the 2-hour refund window closes. This solves my issue because I can blast through this list, even randomly generate a random game to just simply try, and if I don’t like it, I can just uninstall it and move on rather than file for a refund.
Unsure of what is used to access this, probably REST



* [SteamWebAPI](https://github.com/Revadike/InternalSteamWebAPI/wiki) // [SteamWebAPI2](https://steamapi.xpaw.me/) I intend to use this API to find discounts/sales on games, and the reviews for said discounted game(s). This would save a lot of time scrolling, clicking on the game, looking at the reviews, and then going back to the list and doing it all again. With this I intend to make it so I can easily check discounted games and determine whether they are great or not so great
Unsure of what is used to access this, probably REST


---------------------------Could combine the above two? In the sense of, check a free to play game, if it's on steam, check reviews-------------------
